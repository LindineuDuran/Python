# Python Fundamentals [eLearning]
Python Fundamentals takes you from zero experience to a complete understanding of key concepts, edge cases, and using Python for real-world application development. You'll move progressively from the basics to working with larger complex applications. After completing this course, you'll have the skills you need to dive into an existing application or start your own project.

## What you will learn
* Use control statements
* Manipulate primitive and non-primitive data structures
* Use loops to iterate over objects or data for accurate results
* Write encapsulated and succinct Python functions
* Build Python classes using object-oriented programming
* Manipulate files on the file system (open, read, write, and delete)

### Hardware requirements
For an optimal learning experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* Memory: 8GB RAM
* Storage: 4 GB available space

### Software requirements
You must also install in advance the following software:
* Operating system: Windows 7 or Windows 10
* Browser: Google Chrome, Latest Version
* Python 3.6+
* A text editor
